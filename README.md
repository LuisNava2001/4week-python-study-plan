# 🐍 4-Week Python Study Plan

Welcome to my **4-Week Python Study Plan** repository!  
This project is designed to help me **level up Python skills** through hands-on exercises and daily practice.  
The focus is on **problem-solving, APIs, automation, data prep, testing, and interview readiness**.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Be comfortable coding **live under pressure**.
- Build confidence with **APIs, automation, data cleaning, and Python fundamentals**.
- Improve skills in **debugging, writing clean code, and explaining solutions in English**.
- Create a **portfolio of Python projects** organized by topic and difficulty.
